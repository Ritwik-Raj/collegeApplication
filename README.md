    <h1>Description of idea:</h1>
An application which would be available for all the students studying in the college and to allow them to view their profile related to their academic journey.
Teachers can also use this application to update the student records and can also use it to convey important notices.
Application is chosen over a website because an application nowadays is easy to use as compared to a website which requires a browser and the link of the website whereas an application is just a tap and go feature.
